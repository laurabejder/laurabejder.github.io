        <p>Beryl Tsang was 37 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>

        <p>Six months after her mastectomy she was invited to a party and found herself in the need of a breast prosthesis. But she found the available options "too heavy, squishy or ugly," she wrote on the site <a href="https://knitty.com/ISSUEfall05/PATTbits.html" target="_blank">Knitty.com</a>.</p>

        <p>"I thought okay, I needed a breast prosthetic Iâ€™ll just knit myself one so that is what I did. I just went into my knitting, and I found this confetti colored cashmere yarn, and I made myself a tit," Beryl Tsang tells me.</p>

        <p>After the party, she kept knitting tits and eventually she published the pattern online so other people could make them for themselves.</p>

        <p>Since then, the concept and recipe of knitted knockers have spread across the internet. Today, it is the most popular kind of project in the medical knitting category on the community knitting website <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search#pc=medical&sort=popularity&view=captioned_thumbs" target="_blank">Ravelry</a>.</p>
